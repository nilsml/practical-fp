# practical-fp

## Background
This repository contains exercises for my workshop __Functional Typescript Programming with confidence__.
Each exercise corresponds to a topic in the workshop, and ranges from immutability and pure functions to more complex constructions like _eithers_ and _readers_ through the use of the __fp-ts__ library.

## About the contents
Every exercise has at least three files:
|File name|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|exeercise.ts|The actual exercise to solve|
|exercise.test.ts|Unit tests for this particular exercise|
|solution.ts|A possible solution (and sometimes additional solutions)|

Please try to solve the exercises before looking at the solutions.

## Getting started

* `npm i` to install dependencies
* `npm run build` to compile and build
* `npm test` to run the unit tests

The repository contains a Codespace configuration, so it is possible to fork the repository and fire up a codepsace to get started.
By using the codespace you'll get several nice VSCode extensions that runt tests etc automatically.
